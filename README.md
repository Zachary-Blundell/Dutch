Dutch, also known as Marmot, Tamalou, Cactus or Pablo (and a thousand other names), is a friendly, strategic card game, perfect for games with friends or family. The aim of the game is to minimize your score by skilfully replacing the cards in your hand throughout the rounds. Each player starts with four face-down cards, two of which can be memorized at the beginning. This game combines memory, luck and strategy, offering a fun and dynamic experience for all participants.

### **Dutch - Card Game Rules (English Translation)**

#### **Materials & Players**
- A standard deck of 52 cards (without Jokers).
- 2 to 8 players.

#### **Card Distribution**
A dealer is randomly chosen, shuffles the deck, and deals **4 cards** to each player, one at a time, face-down, in a horizontal row in front of them. **Players must keep their cards in the same positions throughout the game.**   

The remaining deck is placed in the center as the draw pile. A discard pile will be created my the first player beside the draw pile, which is visible to all players. **You may not draw from the discard**

### **Rules of Dutch**

#### **Starting the Game**
At the beginning of the game, each player may look at any **two** of their four cards, **memorize** them, before placing them back face-down.  

Once the cards are placed back, players are not allowed to look at them again unless a special card ability allows it.  

The game then begins.

#### **Objective**
The goal of Dutch is to **have the lowest total score with the cards (if there are any) in front of you** at the end of the game.  

When a player believes they have the lowest score at any point, they say **"Dutch!"**, triggering **a final round** for the other players to improve their hands.  

Players will take turns trying to reduce their score by drawing and replacing cards.

### **Card Values**
- Ace = **1 point**  
- Cards 2-10 = **Face value**  
- Jack = **11 points**  
- Queen = **12 points**  
- Black Kings = **20 points**  
- Red Kings = **0 points**   

---

### **Game Flow**
Turns move clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer’s left.  

On their turn, the player will draw a card from the draw pile then: 
  - They may **replace** one of their face-down cards with the drawn card. The replaced card is then placed face-up in the discard pile.  
  - If they do not want to keep the drawn card, they can discard it immediately and **keeping their cards unchanged**. 

- **Simultaneous Discard Rule:**  
  - If a player discards a card and another player has a memorized card of the **same value**, they may also **discard it immediately**.  
  - Example 1: A player discards an **8**, so any other player who remembers they have an **8** (no matter the color) can discard it too.  
  - Example 2: If a player swaps an unknown card and finds it to be a **5**, they can discard both the new and original **5s** if they have one memorized.  

**Penalties:**
- If a player mistakenly tries to discard the wrong card, they must take it back and draw an extra card as a penalty.  
- Looking at a card when not allowed also results in a penalty draw.
- If player A plays the card of player B, player B takes a new card to replace the played card and also takes a penalty.

### **Special Abilities**
- **Ace (A), Queens (Q) and Jacks (J) have special abilities when discarded:**  
  - **Ace (A)** → Allows the player to give one card from the draw pile to any other player
  - **Queen (Q)** → Allows the player to look at any **one card** (their own or an opponent's) before placing it back face-down.  
  - **Jack (J)** → Allows the player to **swap two cards**, either:  
    - One of their own with an opponent’s.  
    - Two of an opponent’s.  
    - Two of their own.  (if desired for some reason)

- If multiple special cards are discarded in succession, abilities are resolved **in order of discard**.

---

### **End of the Game**
- The round continues until one of two conditions
- A player calls **“Dutch!”**  
  - At this point, **one final round** takes place for players to improve their hands.  
  - Players then count up their cards and receive the points they have.
  - If the player who called Dutch **does in fact have the lowest number**, they get to draw a final bonus card that will be a reduction of points. (it is possible to go negative)
  - If the player who called Dutch does **not** in fact have the lowest number they draw a final penalty card that will be an addition of points. 
  - In the case of a tie, the player who said "Dutch" has the advantage.
- A player **discards all their cards** before anyone calls “Dutch,” they immediately win the round with **0 points**, and the game stops i.e. no final round.
  - If a player calls Dutch and then discards all their cards during the final turn, the game stops, and they will still be entitled to the bonus points.

---

### **How to Win Dutch**
- The player with the **lowest score** after multiple rounds wins.  
- A game can end when a player reaches **100 points**, at which point the player with the **lowest total score** wins.

## **Strategies and tips**
- It is advisable to replace your cards at the start of the game, even if the card has a high value; it is always better to know your cards.
- Use early turns to **replace high-value cards** with lower ones.  
  - Alternatively don't do that and hope that opponents will get ride of the high-value cards leading to you getting ride of cards faster. 
- **Memorize** discarded cards to track which values are in play.  
- When a player exchanges a card in their hand with the same card (e.g., they draw a 5 of hearts and exchange it with a 5 of clubs), they can discard their 5 of hearts at the same time. Meaning this might be a good way to verify that the exchanged card is the card you thought it was.
- Play with two decks of cards with the same color back to prevent other players from knowing the location of your cards.
- Likewise, playing with two decks of cards with different colored backs can increase card theft ;)
